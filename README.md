File MGP.java shows calculation for Michelson Gale Pearson experiment
File MM.java shows calculation for Morley Michelson experiment

Calculation for MGP requires triple integration which is approximate by IntegrationApproximator.java
The cube containing the Earth is divided into 80000000 sub-cube and each contribute gravitational drag in MGP experiement.
